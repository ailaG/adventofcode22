NOTES

No testing, no input checking etc because this is scripting & I can't bother
Some code is messier than I'd do IRL
Most tasks are too!


THOUGHTS

Why am I reading files with readline() rather than readlines()? Sometimes it's more convenient,
when it doesn't matter then it's just easier on the memory.
Of course, this isn't enough to crash anything but the idea is nice.
Hence at some point I'll probably just start using readlines().
